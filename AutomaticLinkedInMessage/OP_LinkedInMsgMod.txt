Hey Nick ,
 
Hope you're having a great day! My name is Tirthankar Mittra.
I just graduated with an MS in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and am actively seeking a full-time position.
 
I am writing to express my interest in the System Design Engineer role you advertised on LinkedIn. With over four years of hands-on experience in 5G communications, Python, C++, ML/AI and C and a background in designing scalable systems , my skill set aligns seamlessly with the requirements outlined in the job description. Having honed my software engineering skills through roles at companies such as Samsung and Qualcomm, I am confident I can make meaningful contributions to your team.
 
For your reference, I am attaching my resume. I will also be eager to learn about other job opportunities if you feel I must satisfy the above requirements. Thank you for your time!
