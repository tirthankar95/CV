Upon reviewing the job description, I find that the above role has the perfect mix of data science and designing backend scalable software. I have relevant experience in these domains, and I believe this job will give me ample opportunity to hone my skills. 

The job also entails working with cross functional teams like data scientists, front end, etc. which means continual learning opportunities. The work culture seems nice and since I currently reside in Boulder, the geographical proximity is an added convenience for me.

I am happy to contribute to the promotion of renewal energy. :)
